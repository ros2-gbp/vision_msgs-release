ros-humble-vision-msgs (3.0.0-2jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Add license snippet in CONTRIBUTING.md
  * Decouple source data from the detection/classification messages. (#53 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/53>)
    * Decouple source data from the detection/classification messages.
    This commit drops dependency on sensor_msgs
    * Improved documentation.
  * Merge pull request #52 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/52> from mintar/clarify-class-object-id
    Rename tracking_id -> id, id -> class_id
  * Rename DetectionXD.tracking_id -> id
  * Rename ObjectHypothesis.id -> class_id
  * Merge pull request #51 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/51> from ros-perception/clarify-bbox-size
    Clarify comment for size fields in bounding box messages
  * Revert confusing comment about bbox orientation
  * Merge pull request #50 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/50> from ros-perception/remove-is-tracking-field
    Remove is_tracking field
  * Remove other mentions to is_tracking field
  * Clarify bbox size comment
  * Remove tracking_id from Detection3D as well
  * Remove is_tracking field
    This field does not seem useful, and we are not aware of anyone using it at this time. VisionInfo is probably a better place for this information anyway, if it were needed.
    See #47 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/47> for earlier discussions.
  * Clarify: ObjectHypothesis[] ~= Classification (#49 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/49>)
    * Clarify: ObjectHypothesis[] ~= Classification
    https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/46 requested Array message types for ObjectHypothesis and/or ObjectHypothesisWithPose. As pointed out in the issue, these already exist in the form of the ClassificationXD and DetectionXD message types.
    * Clarify ObjectHypothesisWithPose[] ~= Detection
  * Use composition in ObjectHypothesisWithPose (#48 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/issues/48>)
